# Excel Repo

As a refresher on excel, I took some time to build a handful of basic models that can be used by individuals and businesses. Included in the excel file is a personal budget, model for discounting cash flows, a loan schedule, a depreciation schedule, future value calculator, an example of using goal seeking, a retirement savings forecasting model, and finally an example of using solver and analyzing the decision of whether or not a scuba shop should invest in a pool and teach swimming to cover the payment costs.
